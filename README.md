# Spring-2021-Virtual-Make-A-Thon-Computing-for-Social-Good-and-Innovation
Inspiration:
	We wanted to help people find free food sources because we know that America suffers from massive food insufficiency. We also know the world suffers from mass pollution and extreme hunger--these resources provided will slowly stop these two massive issues. Resulting in a cleaner world with equal opportunity for food.

Our Mission:
This is a website that was created to help those in need of free food resources. It was also created to help allow restaurants, food trucks, grocery stores, and anything in between to becoming more waste-free by giving back to the community.

Technology Used:
Google Docs | Slack | Google Sites | IBM Watson AI | OBS | IBM Cloud | Github | Draw.io

A few things we used are Watson-discovery, Tutorials/chat-app, Use your code to combat food waste, and Bmccmakeathon/spring-2021-computing-for-social-good-innovation.

Challenges:
	The challenges we faced were finding organizations around America, more specifically New York City, that were giving away free food, groceries, and meals to people in need. We researched, found, and double-checked our sources to make sure they were accurate and still current through Covid-19 and this pandemic.

Our Future:
	We hope this website can stay up, be updated, and help everyone in need of food.

What we have learned:
Through IBM we were able to learn how to build and deploy a chatbot on a website.

We have learned how to work on google sites.

We also learned how to work as a team to achieve our goal to build our project.
